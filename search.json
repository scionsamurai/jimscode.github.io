Functions are one of the core building blocks in JavaScript. Functions allow you to group one or more related statements together to perform a specific task. Functions allow you to logically organize your code into reusable, modular blocks. You can call the same function multiple times without having to rewrite the logic each time. Functions hide complex operations behind a simple interface. Variables and state are localized to the function scope. Functions declared like this are hoisted to the top. Function declarations load before anything else in a JavaScript file, so you can call a function declaration before it appears in code. Function declarations are convenient when you want to refer to the function simply by name elsewhere. Function expressions avoid using unnecessary global namespaces created by lots of function declarations. s best practice to use function declarations for major important helper functions you will reuse often.
